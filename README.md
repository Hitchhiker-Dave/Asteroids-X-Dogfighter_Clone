# Asteroids-X-Dogfighter_Clone
 Basic Asteroids Study but with added AI Enemies

MVP Plan:
-Get Basic Movement (w/ screen looping); DONE
-Impliment Asteriods (3 tiers)
	-1st tier is stationary/very slow, later tiers are faster but smaller
-Impliement Shooting
-Impliement Asteroid Destruction
	-Destroying an Asteroid creates a smaller/later tier asteroid 
-Impliment Enemy w/ Basic AI (Homes in on player, can ram into asteroids)

Nice to Haves:
-Pretty Graphics (Could actually handraw these for once)
-Sounds
